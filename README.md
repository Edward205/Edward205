# What I do
I like to learn how computers work from the ground up and to see how software works. I am very committed to making fast and reliable software for the good of the people (including your mom).

I also translate stuff in Romanian

Software I've translated:
  * ShareX (100%)
  * Revolt (>90% by me)
  * NewPipe (fixed mistakes and updated translations)
  * Blokada (contributed)
  * Trezor Suite
  * Rock Life (game on Steam)
  * See other projects I've contributed to on Crowdin and Transifex:

While translating I usually follow Microsoft's terminology: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/language
